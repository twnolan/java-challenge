Exercises Completed - 1 and 2

Exercise 3 is almost completed - Questions 1 and 3 are completed with 
more than 50% of the work done for question 2.  I ran into an issue with 
the request payload in question 1 and this took some time to resolve. 
I was still creating the schema for validation when I went over the 10 
hours limit. 

Outstanding work to be done is as follows:

1). Complete the schema elements for `owner` and `files` sections within 
the `list-gist-schema.json` in the `src/main/test/resources` folder.

2). Validate request against created schema via assertion.

3). Configuration for outputing pass/fail status for each test case.
