# Instructions

The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability in creating tests 
against a Restful API service.  
 
For this we will use a subset of the GitHub gist gistAPI. The tests should 
ensure that the API implementation conforms to the GitHub documentation. 

### Task

The tests should cover: 
 
1. Assert that the create call creates gists. 
2. Assert that listing gists returns the fields that the docs specify. 
3. Assert that the delete call deletes a gist. 

There is no need to test the OAuth authentication process.
